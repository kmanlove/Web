						<h2 class="title"> Summer learning</h2>
						<div class="entry">
							<p>It's been my good luck this month to attend two different modeling workshops, Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases (EEID) at the University of Michigan, and the Rocky Mountain Math Consortium (RMMC) workshop on mathematical modeling for ecology and epidemiology at the University of Wyoming.  
<p>
<p>
EEID was an awesome workshop -- the instructors were engaging and the material was presented such that everyone from experienced modelers to first-time R users learned something new. I'm glad this workshop came first, since it forced me to transition out of my bighorn sheep box and into comparative biological thinking. The emphasis was on modeling infectious disease dynamics from data, using both applied mathematical and statistical techniques. For me, the most critical information came in lectures on trajectory matching for timeseries data, an introduction to ggplot2, and in talking with other students about their systems (and strengthening my array of systems with which to draw comparisons).
<p>
<p>
The second workshop was the Rocky Mountain Math Consortium's two-week applied math workshop at the University of Wyoming. This was a much "mathier" group than EEID. The emphasis was very much on applied math techniques, which left me initially feeling a bit like a fish out of water. However, it turns out that there's more cross-over between the algebraic techniques I've used in linear statistical modeling and the matrix models for demography than I'd previously recognized.  The instructors did a great job of presenting demographic theory from (close to) first principles, which really clarified my understanding of a number of population models
<p>
<p>
On the whole, the two workshops left me with a bunch of new ideas, and though I don't have a use for them right this minute, I'm very happy to have new equipment in the proverbial toolbox.  Time very well spent!  </p>
